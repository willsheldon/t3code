# Message composer

Messages can contain up to 120,000 characters. If a draft is longer, T3 Code keeps it in the
composer and shows how many characters need to be removed. Shorten the draft or split it into
multiple messages, then send again in the same thread.

You can attach images up to 10 MB. On servers that support file uploads, web and desktop can also
attach text files, PDFs, ZIP archives, and other files. Each file can be up to the limit advertised
by the server, capped at 50 MB. Each message can contain up to eight attachments in total. Files
upload directly to the environment, where your agent can read, copy, or edit them by their file path.

On web and desktop, attachments upload as soon as you add them. The send button becomes available
after every upload finishes. Failed uploads can be retried or removed. On mobile, attachments are
currently limited to images.

If you reload before a file finishes uploading, the draft keeps the file's name and shows **Attach
again** next to it. Attach the file again or remove it, then send.

On web and desktop, HEIC and HEIF photos are automatically converted to JPEG when you drag them into
the composer or paste them into a message.

On mobile, the model picker shows each OpenCode model's upstream provider, such as Anthropic,
GitHub Copilot, or OpenCode Zen, beneath its name. Search by that provider name to narrow the list
when starting a thread or changing an existing thread's model.

## Prompt stash

Use the default shortcut, `Cmd+S` on macOS or `Ctrl+S` on Windows and Linux, to stash the current
prompt and its attachments after all file uploads finish. Restore the entry later from the stash
menu. Stashes that contain files must be restored in the environment where those files were
uploaded. Stashed files stay uploaded on the server for 24 hours. If you restore an entry after
that, the file comes back with **Attach again** next to it. Attach the file again or remove it, then
send.

## Queued messages

On web and desktop, the composer shows **Interrupt** while the agent is working and the draft is
empty. Adding text or attachments replaces it with a steer arrow. Click it to send a message into
the active turn, or press `Enter` on desktop. Hold `Cmd` on macOS or `Ctrl` on Windows and Linux to
switch the button to a queue icon. Click while holding that key, or press `Cmd+Enter` or
`Ctrl+Enter` on desktop, to queue the message for after the active turn.

Queued messages appear above the composer. Rows show a thumbnail of any attached image alongside
the text. Drag a row by its handle to reorder it, use the handle's arrow keys, promote the message
to a steer, or remove it.

The pencil on a queued row opens that message in the composer for editing. The original message
stays in the queue until you save, and its row is highlighted while you edit. The message's
attachments appear above the text with a remove control, and new images can be added the usual way.
The checkmark saves the queued message in place; **Cancel** on its row leaves it unchanged. Whatever
you had typed in the composer before starting the edit is restored afterwards. If the queued
message starts or is removed while you are editing, the edit ends: changed content moves into the
composer when it is empty, and is discarded otherwise.

Agents connected through T3 Code's built-in orchestration tools can inspect the same queue, edit
user-authored queued prompts and attachments, reorder or cancel queued work, and promote a queued
message into steering. These controls use the same project scope and permission ceiling as ordinary
thread messages. They cannot rewrite T3 Code's automatic completion deliveries or cancel an active
turn through a queue-only action.

## Commands and skills

Type `/` to open the command menu. Type `$` to find and add a skill. Skill rows show their source,
such as System, Personal, Project, or App.

On mobile, these menus are available on the **New task** screen before you start a thread. They
use the skills and commands from the selected environment and provider.

By default, the `/` menu includes skills. To keep this menu command-only, turn off **Show skills in
slash menu** in **Settings → General**. Skill results use the `/skill:Skill Name` label and add the
same `$name` skill token to your message. The original skill name remains searchable. If the provider
also reports that skill as a native slash command, T3 Code hides the duplicate native entry and keeps
the `/skill:Skill Name` label.

On desktop, press `Cmd+Enter` on macOS or `Ctrl+Enter` on Windows and Linux from a new thread to
start it in the background. T3 Code opens another new thread and shows an **Open** action for the
thread that started. The new thread keeps the selected workspace mode and base branch. If **New
worktree** is selected, each background thread creates its own worktree.
